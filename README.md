# ðŸŒ³ PharmaTree: Data-Driven Insights for Drug Prediction

This repository contains a machine-learning-powered application that predicts the most suitable drug type for patients based on their medical attributes. It leverages a Decision Tree Classifier and was created as part of the IBM Machine Learning Lab, integrated with additional customizations and optimizations.

## Overview

The **Drug Decision Assistant** is designed to:
- Predict the best drug for patients based on their medical history and attributes.
- Provide clear visualizations and insights for better interpretability.
- Deliver a user-friendly interface for predictions, data analysis, and model performance.

---

## Features

- **Model:** Decision Tree Classifier.
- **Input Features:**
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Blood Pressure (BP)
  - Cholesterol Levels
  - Sodium-to-Potassium Ratio (Na_to_K)
- **Prediction Outcome:** One of five drug types.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Displays feature importance and prediction probabilities.
- **Educational Context:** Developed as part of the IBM Machine Learning course on Coursera.

---

## How It Works

The system employs a supervised learning algorithm to classify data and predict the appropriate drug. It:
1. Encodes categorical variables like sex, BP, and cholesterol.
2. Trains a Decision Tree Classifier on labeled data.
3. Predicts the outcome for new patient inputs with accuracy displayed.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used is sourced from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and includes:
- Patient attributes such as age, sex, BP, cholesterol, and Na_to_K ratio.
- The target variable, "Drug," categorizes the type of medication.

File: `drug200.csv`

## Components

### Application File (`app.py`)

The main Streamlit application file:
- **Handles User Input:** Collects patient information like age, sex, and medical stats.
- **Displays Results:** Predicts drug type and visualizes probabilities.
- **Tabs:** Divides sections into Prediction, Data Analysis, Model Performance, and How It Works.
- **Custom Styling:** Implements a cohesive and user-friendly design with CSS.

---

### Drug Predictor (`drug_predictor.py`)

Defines the machine learning model:
- **Training Function:** Splits the data into training and test sets, trains a Decision Tree Classifier, and returns accuracy.
- **Prediction Function:** Predicts drug type for a given input.

---

### Data Processor (`data_processor.py`)

Handles data preprocessing:
- **Load Data:** Reads and encodes the dataset using LabelEncoder for categorical variables.
- **Process Input:** Prepares user input for prediction by transforming categorical variables.

---
